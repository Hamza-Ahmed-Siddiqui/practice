          <p>The journey of flavors remarkable success starts from 1981 when the dream of one man became a reality.

            A visionary entrepreneur, an avowed humanist and a committed philanthropist, Mr. Sikander Sultan, Chairman, Shan Foods (Pvt.) Ltd, helped pave the way to success by pioneering in the spice business with a single room operation.

Overtime, the company prospered and Mr. Sultan decided to launch his very own brand, “SHAN” and since then there has been no turning back!
            
            Today, flavors is a powerful global brand that has presence in over 70 countries across 5 continents.
